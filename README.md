### 7. Prompt Engineer

#### Reverse Prompt Engineering

- [Blog - Reverse Prompt Engineering for Fun and (no) Profit](https://www.latent.space/p/reverse-prompt-eng)
- [Jail Break - find a weak point](https://www.jailbreakchat.com/)

#### Best practice

[OpenAI API - Text completion - Prompt design](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/prompt-design)

- Be clear and specific
- Use natural language
  - for model to capture nuances and subtitles of human language
- Include relavant keywords or initial response
- Experiment with different prompt structures
  - question-based or statement or partial sentence
- Fine-tune the prompt
  - adjust wording
  - adding or removing keywords
  - try different sentence structure

### 9. Blog Writer

## Section 3. OpenAI API Practice 2

### 10. Sentiment Analysis with Reddit API

```sh
poetry install
poetry self add poetry-dotenv-plugin
# poetry add dotenv # cannot install it: not supporting PEP 517 builds.
poetry add praw
```

- [Create Reddit API Key](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
  - Create an app
    - name: sentiment-test
    - Type: script

### 11. Auto Docstring

#### Docstring example

- one-line docstrings
- multi-line docstrings
- reStructuredText(reST) docstrings

### 12. Translate News

[News API](https://newsapi.org)

### 13. Fine Tuning

- Any proprietary data can be possible to train the GPT models
- Fine tuning has already the base model, so it saves resources.

- [OpenAI API - Fine Tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)
- [tiktoken - Calculate token number](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)
  - then we could estimate the cost

#### Data prep tool

##### Calculate token

```sh
poetry add tiktoken
```

##### prepare jsonl file

- File format: CSV, TSV, XLSX, JSON or JSONL
  - JSONL is preferred

```sh
poetry add pandas

openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f 13-fine-tuning-data.json
# Analyzing...

# - Your JSON file appears to be in a JSONL format. Your file will be converted to JSONL format
# - Your file contains 2 prompt-completion pairs. In general, we recommend having at least a few hundred examples. We've found that performance tends to linearly increase for every doubling of the number of examples
# - All prompts end with suffix ` revenue in 2022?`. This suffix seems very long. Consider replacing with a shorter suffix, such as ` ->`
# - All prompts start with prefix `What is `
# - All completions end with suffix ` billion`
# - The completion should start with a whitespace character (` `). This tends to produce better results due to the tokenization we use. See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more details

# Based on the analysis we will perform the following actions:
# - [Necessary] Your format `JSON` will be converted to `JSONL`
# - [Recommended] Add a whitespace character to the beginning of the completion [Y/n]: Y


# Your data will be written to a new JSONL file. Proceed [Y/n]: Y

# Wrote modified file to `13-fine-tuning-data_prepared.jsonl`
# Feel free to take a look!

# Now use that file when fine-tuning:
# > openai api fine_tunes.create -t "13-fine-tuning-data_prepared.jsonl"

# After youâ€™ve fine-tuned a model, remember that your prompt has to end with the indicator string ` revenue in 2022?` for the model to start generating completions, rather than continuing with the prompt. Make sure to include `stop=[" billion"]` so that the generated texts ends at the expected place.
# Once your model starts training, it'll approximately take 2.47 minutes to train a `curie` model, and less for `ada` and `babbage`. Queue will approximately take half an hour per job ahead of you.
```

#### Create fine tuned model based on

```sh
# openai api fine_tunes.create -t <TRAIN_FILE_ID_OR_PATH> -m <BASE_MODEL>
openai api fine_tunes.create -t 13-02-fine-tuning-data_prepared.jsonl -m babbage

#### use OpenAI API with my fine tuned model

```sh
python 13-fine-tuning.py
```

### 14. Use Text Embedding and Find Document Similarity

[OpenAI API - Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)

#### Model Hallucination

- Model hallucination referes to **a phenomenon where an AI language model, like ChatGPT, generates output that seems plausible but is not accurate, factual, or relavant to the input it has received.**
- Causes can be
  - incomplete, biases or incorrect traning dataset
  - over-generalized from the training dataset
  - the model attempts to generate uncertain response
- Solution
  - add "answer only if you are 100% centain"

#### Step 1: generate embedded file

[14-fortune_1000_revenue_2022.csv](./03-openai-practice-2/data/14-fortune_1000_revenue_2022.csv)

```sh
python 14-01-text-embedding.py
# it will add two columns, "info" and "ada_embedding" to the csv file.
```

#### Step 2: find the most similar info and ask to chat gpt

```sh
python 14-02-document-similarity.py
```

### 15. ChatGPT API - Chat completion

#### ChatGPT API Role

- sytstem: assign the specific situation and response style
- user: you
- assistant: ChatGPT

#### Models

## Section 4. ChatGPT Plus practice

### 16. create a storybook(ft. Midjourney)

- Chat

### 17. create an avatar (ft Midjourney, Elevenlabs and D-ID)

- [Midjourney - AI Images](https://www.midjourney.com/)
  - prompt:
    - imagine a medium shot of white woman wearing a Tshirt, captured with a Nikon D850 and a Nikon AF-s NIKKOR 70-200mm f/2.8E FL ED VR lens, lit with high-key lightning to create a soft and ethereal feel, a shallow depth of field --ar 2:3
- [ChatGPT - AI Text](https://chat.openai.com/)
  - prompt:
    - Write an engaging script for an AI avatar for a youtube video. The main theme will be something followings. "Hi, welcome to codemke Youtube channel, I am not a real human and it is not my voice as you know. I was created with AI tools along with MidJourney. This script was written with ChatGPT Plus. And the voice is from ElevenLabs and the vedio is created with D-ID
  - result:
    - AI Avatar: Hi, there! Welcome to the Codemke YouTube channel. I'm not a real human, and as you might have guessed, this isn't my real voice. I was created using advanced AI tools in collaboration with MidJourney.
    - [The AI avatar looks around the screen, as if taking in its surroundings.]
    - AI Avatar: And you know what? I'm pretty impressed with what I'm seeing! This channel is all about coding, programming, and everything in between. If you're a tech enthusiast, this is the place to be.
    - [The AI avatar leans in towards the camera, as if about to share a secret.]
    - AI Avatar: Now, here's something you might not know. This script you're hearing was actually written with ChatGPT Plus, one of the most advanced language models out there. Pretty cool, right?
    - [The AI avatar takes a step back and gestures towards the screen.]
    - AI Avatar: And the voice you're hearing is from ElevenLabs. They specialize in creating realistic and engaging voices for AI avatars like me. And the video itself was created using cutting-edge technology from D-ID.
    - [The AI avatar smiles.]
